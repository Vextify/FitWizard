      <h1>What is BMI?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a numerical value that represents the
        relationship between a person's weight and height. It is a commonly used
        tool to assess whether an individual's weight falls within a healthy
        range. BMI provides a general indication of body composition and can
        help identify potential health risks associated with weight. The
        calculation involves dividing an individual's weight (in kilograms) by
        their height (in meters) squared. The resulting BMI value is then
        categorized into different ranges, such as underweight, normal weight,
        overweight, or obese.
      </p>

        To better understand where your BMI falls within the range of healthy
        weights, refer to the graph below. This visual representation will
        assist you in determining whether your BMI is within the recommended
        range for your specific height and weight.
